I am a doctoral candidate in the Computational Analysis and Modeling Program and an instructor in the Mathematics and Statistics Program.  My research interests are in mathematics and artificial intelligence. Particularly graph theoretic problems and using graph theoretic techniques in knowledge representation and reasoning applications.

I have taught mathematics and statistics courses across the undergraduate curriculum at a number of institutions.  Currently, I teach introductory courses through Calculus II. My teaching is student focused and my hope is that all of my students leave the classroom feeling more confident in their abilities as critical thinkers and problem solvers.
