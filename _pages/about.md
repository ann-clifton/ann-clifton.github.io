## About Me

I was born and raised in eastern North Carolina and am an avid outdoorswoman. When I'm not doing mathematics, I enjoy offshore fishing, fly fishing, hunting, hiking, and backpacking.

## Appointments

I am an Assistant Professor in the Mathematics and Statistics Program at Louisiana Tech University and an affiliate of the <a href='https://www.latech.edu/engineering-science/research-and-innovation/iserc.php'>Integrated STEM Education Research Center (ISERC)</a>. Prior to this role, I served as an Instructor at Louisiana Tech from 2020 to 2025 and previously taught at <a href='https://www.cedarcrest.edu'>Cedar Crest College</a>, <a href='https://www.lafayette.edu'>Lafayette College</a>, and the <a href='https://sc.edu'>University of South Carolina</a>.

## Research

My research interests are in structural graph theory and mathematics education. In graph theory, I study vertex partitioning, coloring, and reconstruction problems, with a particular interest in applications and algorithmic complexity. In mathematics education, my work focuses on alternative grading practices, fostering cross-disciplinary connections in student learning, and building a sense of belonging and community through informal learning environments.

## Education

I earned my PhD in Computational Analysis and Modeling from Louisiana Tech University in August 2025 under the direction of Galen Turner. I also hold an MS in Mathematics from the University of South Carolina, an MA in Mathematics from East Carolina University, and a BA in Mathematics and Hispanic Studies from East Carolina University.

## Teaching

I have taught courses across the undergraduate mathematics curriculum, from College Algebra to Discrete Mathematics and Probability and Statistics. My teaching is student-centered, with the goal that every student leaves my classroom feeling more confident in their abilities as critical thinkers and problem solvers.
