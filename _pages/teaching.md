As an Instructor at Louisiana Tech, I have taught Math 100/101 - College Algebra with corequisite support, Math 102/103 - Applied College Algebra with corequisite support, Math 130 - Contemporary Mathematics, Stat 200 - Introductory Statistics, and Math 241 - Calculus I.

In my previous appointments, I also taught Calculus II, Calculus for Business, and Probability and Statistics for mathematics majors.  I also successfully proposed and designed an honors course on women in mathematics aimed at liberal arts and STEM majors.

My courses are designed to foster an inclusive and active environment in which students are encouraged to ask questions and engage in meaningful discussions.  I combine a variety of techniques from active learning, inquiry based learning, and informal assessments to help students approach new problems with confidence and develop the skills to arrive at efficient and effective solutions.
