abstract="We all know the world loves an underdog. But who should have won? Simulation models can give us a way to reproduce contest scenarios using computer power, allowing us to simulate versions of reality numerous times and observe a wide range of possible outcomes. Using basic probability calculations and a wide range of programming tools, we can mimic real life and answer such questions as ``how likely is Team A to win the tournament?'', ``how biased would Judge B have to be in favor of an athlete for them to come out on top?'', or ``is there a particular voting structure that would allow for the emergence of Candidate C as the winner?'' In this chapter, we lay out the fundamental skills for pursuing answers to questions like these via simulation, and leave the interested reader with a set of potential research projects on the theme of evaluating fairness, bias, and other issues relevant to ranking schemes and judging protocols.",
